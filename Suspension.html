  <p>This section of the manual goes over the what, how, and why of a vehicles steering and suspension systems. In this chapter we'll go over the different types of steering and suspension systems used in modern day vehicles and the compents that make up those systems as well as how they operate.</p>

    <h4>What is it?</h4>
  <p>A shock absorber is a part whose sole purpose is to dampen and control the force emitted by the springs in the vehicles suspension system. They control the rate at which the vehicle experiences up and down movement after a bump in the road.
  </p>
  <p>The shock absorber helps dampen the up and down movement of the vehicle springs by converting movement energy into heat by forcing fluid through small holes inside the shock absorber.
  </p>

  <h4>How it works</h4>
  <p>Shock absorbers have fluid inside of them that when the vehicle goes over a bump and the shock is compressed the fluid is forced upward. Well if the fluid is just instantly thrust upward it wouldn't result in a very comfortable ride, so small openings or <i>orifices</i> are placed within the chamber limit the amount of fluid that flows upward therefore decreasing the amount of time the shock compresses and decompresses. Resulting in a more comfortable ride.
  </p>
  <p>In order to further control the rate at which the shock absorber dampens, engineers designed a piston inside the chamber with the fluid. This piston has round valves attached to it so that as the piston is moving up and down in the chamber it is also forcing the fluid in and out of the working chamber.
  </p>
  <p>A good rule for shocks is the more fluid pressure thats dropped then the more fluid thats moved through the orifice. Which means more dampening. This is why bigger shocks provide better dampening then smaller ones.
